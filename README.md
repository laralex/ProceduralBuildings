# Procedural buildings 3D models generator

This project was a CS bachelor thesis project at Saint Petersburg Polytechnic University in Russia. 

The main project's target is to make a scalable prototype for procedural generation of buildings 3D models 
from a few parameters (e.g. height, number of floors, type of window, density of windows, symmetry, footprint of building and so on. 

The solution contains a generator part, which can be either an embeddable C# library or a HTTP server with a primitive API.
There's also a generator's HTTP client example implemented - a visualizer program for previewing generated models.

Generation algorithms are based on formal grammars theory. 

P.S. Defended the thesis with a highest score :)
