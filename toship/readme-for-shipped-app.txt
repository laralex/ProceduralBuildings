To start working with the procedural generator, open a file with administrator rights:
bin/WindowsProceduralBuildingsGenerator.exe

(no need to open any other application)

From there on, you can tweak generation configuration and start the generation. 
The generated model (without textures) will be previewed in a separate application window.
